# Video Editing Software - case study
## Overview
This case study describes the visual design development of a vlogging editing app that I designed during the first week at General Assembly.

The brand personality and style was established and incorporated into the app design, and after several rounds of user testing and iterations the mock-up moved from low-fidelity to high-fidelity design.

## Design approach
The British Councilâ€™s Double Diamond approach to iterative design was implemented as a framework through the visual design process.

## The problem
Pinusa needs to find a way to organize and edit her vlog projects because she is struggling with the number of platforms she is currently using.
