# Video Editing Software - case study
## Overview
This case study describes the visual design development of a vlogging editing app that I designed during the first week at General Assembly.

The brand personality and style was established and incorporated into the app design, and after several rounds of user testing and iterations the mock-up moved from low-fidelity to high-fidelity design.

## Design approach
The British Council’s Double Diamond approach to iterative design was implemented as a framework through the visual design process.

## The problem
Pinusa needs to find a way to organize and edit her vlog projects because she is struggling with the number of platforms she is currently using.

I tested different colour schemes for the interface based on the vibrant colours from the mood board and learnt that Pinusa found the primary coral/ green background to be too distracting. Pinusa found option 3 — black background helped her to focus on the footage itself. This bears relevance to other video editing applications such as I-Movie where a dark background is also used.

Further developing option 3 — The coral brand colours were therefore incorporated into the the tab bar iconography and text, to establish the brand identity.
